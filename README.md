# Multiplayer-RPG-Game

## Description
This is a basic game that I decided to work on so I can lean how to uses javascript and flask. The game itself is very barebones and I will maybe get it to a stage with 1 quest, and add some custom assets for objects but this was never meant to be anything besides a reason to learn javascript with flask.

## Usage
Just call ./run.py from its directorty then navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000.
You will require the following modules flask and the flask sockets.
